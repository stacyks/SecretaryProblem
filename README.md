# SecretaryProblem
Exploring the Secretary problem (with full information wip). 

The secretary problem occurs when there are x amount of applicants, and the objective is to take the best one. However, once you pass up an applicant you cannot reoffer them the position. The classic problem assumes that the applicant will always accept the offer. Typically, this problem is approached with the 37% rule/"look then leap"â€”you look uncommitedly for 37% of the applicants, and then afterwards (the leap phase) you take the next applicant that is better than what you have seen in the look phase. 

This project tests the look then leap strategy. It uses an OOP style in which there is an Applicant and Driver class. Each applicant is given an "id" and a score, and the Driver is used to run trials based on a fixed pool of applicants.
